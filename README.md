# Ableton-12-Theme
Remake of the official Ableton 12 theme for older versions


## Description

This is a remake of the official Ableton Live 12 Theme for Ableton Live 10 and 11. I have changed the color palette in agreement with the original one (see the images below).

The UI now feels a litte bit smoother and lighter. Note that features such as the rounded corners of the arrangement view are not implemented.

# Ableton-12-Theme
Remake of the official Ableton 12 theme for older versions (10 and 11).


## Description

This is a personal remake of the official Ableton Live 12 Theme for Ableton Live 10 and 11. I have finely ajusted the color palette with respect to the original one (see the images below).

Globally, the UI now feels a litte bit smoother and lighter. Note that features such as the rounded corners of the arrangement view are not implemented.


## Installation

Windows: Download and insert the file "Live12Theme.ask" inside this folder C: > ProgramData > Ableton > Live 11 Suite > Resources > Themes 

Macos: Download and insert the file "Live12Theme.ask" inside this folder /Applications/Ableton Live 11 Suite.app/Contents/App-Resources/Themes

For both cases, the exact path may be different depending on which version of Ableton you are using (Live 11 Suite in my case).
